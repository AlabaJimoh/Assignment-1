3. Design  
Develop a detailed design document that shows the software's structure, components, interfaces, and data models. Also, design the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX).

4. Implementation (Coding)  
Write the software code based on the design document. Use programming languages, frameworks, and tools to create the software.

5. Testing  
Check that the software meets the needs and works as expected. Perform unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing.

6. Deployment  
Launch the software for users. Set up the necessary environment and infrastructure.

7. Maintenance  
Monitor the software, fix issues, and make updates as needed. Gather feedback from users and stakeholders to guide future development.

These steps can overlap or be repeated. The SDLC offers a clear way to develop software, ensuring the final product meets quality, function, and user needs.

(D) Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Here's a comparison of the Waterfall and Agile methodologies:

 Comparison of Waterfall and Agile Methodologies

Waterfall Methodology

1. Follows a step-by-step approach: Each phase must be completed before moving to the next.
2. Predicts outcomes: All requirements are gathered at the start, and a project plan is created based on them.
3. Focuses on documentation: Detailed documents are created before any development work begins.
4. Resists change: Once the project starts, making changes is difficult and expensive.

Agile Methodology

1. Takes an iterative approach: Development occurs in small parts, and feedback is gathered regularly.
2. Adapts easily: Requirements can change and improve throughout the project.
3. Encourages teamwork: Teams from different areas collaborate, and customer feedback is important.
4. Welcomes changes: Adjustments to the project are expected and can be made easily.

When to Use Waterfall:

1. For safety-critical systems: Work on systems with strict regulations, like those in aerospace or healthcare.
